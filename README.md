## Briefly how it  works

This is a Solidity code for an Ethereum smart contract written in the ERC20 token standard. The contract implements the SMRT16 token, which is a referral bonus token. The contract inherits the ERC20 interface and Ownable contract for token functionality and owner management.

The contract has a constructor that initializes the _usd token address and creates a pre-mint of 16 million tokens. The _referrers mapping is used to keep track of the referrers of the buyers. The Purchased event is triggered every time a buyer buys tokens with a referrer.

The contract has several functions, including:

* mint: Only the owner can mint tokens.
* buyFor: This function is called by a buyer to buy S16 tokens. The referrer is specified in the function call.
* _setReferrer: sets the referrer who will receive the referral bonuses.
* _payBonuses: calculates and distributes the referral bonuses to the referrers up to the 4th level.
* _min: returns the minimum value between two values.
* _burn: burns a specified amount of tokens.
* referrerOf: returns the referrer of a buyer.
* _createPersonalContract: creates a personal contract for a buyer.

This code implements a referral bonus system that rewards buyers for bringing new buyers to the platform. The system calculates bonuses based on the number of referrers and the amount of tokens purchased. The bonuses are paid in the _usd token and a small fee is burned in the process.
