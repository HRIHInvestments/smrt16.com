        SMRT16 generates its funding from token sales, rewarding participants through marketing bonuses.

        "howitworks": `
        It works as follows: everyone who has ever bought a SMRT16 token through a DApp or directly using the functions of a smart contract becomes a project partner. 
        It is impossible to buy tokens without specifying a referrer. After the purchase, your wallet address becomes your referral code at the same time. 
        And if you add smrt16.com/ and your wallet address, you get your referral link, for example: smrt16.com/0x5c580f5b34f7f7df64f5336f038c8705014a51ee.

        Thus, you become an agent of the project and now you can invite other people to buy SMRT16 tokens. For you - a four-level referral system, in which up to 93.75% of the transaction value is distributed among users directly involved in the transaction. Instant payment of referral bonuses occurs automatically and is guaranteed by a smart contract code on the blockchain.

        The general rule is that each next level of referral bonus has half the amount of bonuses of the previous level, therefore:

        Referral reward of the 1st level is 50% or 1/2 of the deal.
        Referral reward of the 2nd level is 25% or 1/4 of the transaction.
        Level 3 referral reward is 12.5% or 1/8 of the deal.
        Level 4 referral reward is 6.25% or 1/16 of the transaction.


Partners of the SMTR16 project are highly motivated to engage in marketing - after all, referral bonuses are paid instantly. But let's say a user wants to invest, get a few referrals, and then switch to something else. And what? His referral program is not going anywhere. It will work for a year or two and always make a profit, as long as the smart contract on the blockchain works.
